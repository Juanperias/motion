# Contributing to Motion

## Creating a Branch

To contribute, please create your own branch following this pattern: `<user>-dev`. This helps in keeping contributions organized and identifiable. After making your changes, contribute by making a pull request (PR) to the `dev` branch. Ensure that your branch is up to date with `dev` before creating a PR.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow commit lint rules, and be clear in their objective. Use simple present tense to describe your changes, e.g., "Add new collision detection algorithm." Avoid any kind of offensive language or inappropriate comments. Clear and respectful communication ensures a professional and collaborative environment.

## Documenting Features

If you add new features, remember to document them thoroughly. Update relevant sections in the codebase, including `README.md`, and any other documentation files. This helps other developers understand the changes and how to utilize the new features effectively.

## Adding Dependencies

Do not add dependencies unless it is strictly necessary. Consider the impact on the project, such as increased build times, potential security vulnerabilities, and maintenance overhead. If you must add a dependency, include a detailed justification in your PR, explaining why it is essential and how it benefits the project.

Thank you for your contributions and for helping improve Motion! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.
